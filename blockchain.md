#Definition
A blockchain : chained (linked) blocks 
Each block contain :
    - A timestamp
    - A list of transactions
    - A cryptographic hash of the previous block
    - A cryptographic nonce (for proof of work)
This ensures :
    - Data can't be changed without breaking the whole chain
    - Consensus is achieved through mining or validation
